### DoHTTP to Postman collections converter

#### the story
I had been using doHttp until postman have finaly released their standalone version for macos. We all know - Postman is
the one of the best. I had a lot of collections in doHttp and didn't want to lose them.
Here it is - DoHTTP 2 Postman collections converter

#### Concerns
- There is no support for subfolders in Postman at the moment, so if you're using it - split them into Collections + folders somehow.
- I didn't test compatibility with file parameters

Use this on your own risk :-)
